# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
This repository contains the works carried out in the subject "Algorithms and Data Structures" at the Faculty of Engineering (UBA).

- ADTs: Students were required to implement different abstract data types, such as a stack, queue, list, hash, heap and binary search tree.

- TP1: The objective of this evaluation is to develop a voting system, a program that works with previously implemented Abstract Data Types (ADTs), design new ADTs as necessary, and incorporate file handling and input/output/error streams.

- TP2: The Algueiza Airport manages the arrival and departure of planes. The airport operators have requested the implementation of a flight inquiry system that allows them to order, filter, analyze, and retrieve information about different flights.

- TP3: In this final assignment, the task involves working with graphs to perform various queries related to flights between cities. The assignment includes working with minimum paths and minimum spanning trees. [Task Link](https://algoritmos-rw.github.io/algo2/tps/2023_1/tp3/)
